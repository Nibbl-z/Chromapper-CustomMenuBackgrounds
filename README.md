# Chromapper-CustomMenuBackgrounds

This plugin allows you to replace the menu backgrounds of Chromapper with your own images!

(This plugin only allows .png, .jpg, and .jpeg images.)
(not tested for macos or linux so hopefully it works there!)
(this may slow down loading screens a bit)

# How To Use

Press Windows+R then type appdata. Navigate to LocalLow > BinaryElement > ChroMapper > CustomBackgrounds

"Hereâ€™s how to access the Library folder in macOS:
